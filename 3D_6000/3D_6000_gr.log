[31mLEGACY MODES ENABLED:[39m
 This application uses the legacy material output option: material properties are output only on TIMESTEP_END, not INITIAL. To remove this message, set 'use_legacy_material_output' to false in this application. If there are gold output files that contain material property output for which output occurs on INITIAL, then these will generate diffs due to zero values being stored, and these tests should be re-golded.
